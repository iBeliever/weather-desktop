        <p>Check the weather in a simple and easy-to-use manner. With no ads and a beautiful interface, it's easier and faster than checking weather websites!</p>

<p>Weather Desktop provides access to multiple named locations, with previews of all available at the same time. It displays detailed current conditions,  daily forecasts for the next seven days, and hourly forecasts for the next 24 hours. For people on the go, Weather Desktop can automatically determine your location using your IP address. In addition, users can easily add their own backgrounds, weather-related or not, to the application. </p>

<p>Don't want to open the application? Just enable the option to set your current wallpaper to depict the current weather conditions!</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Ubuntu</h3>

<p>If you are using Ubuntu, you can buy the application from the Ubuntu Software Center for $2.99. It will help to support my work, plus you will get a prepackaged, automatically updated version of the application that also contains my API key precompiled into it. <em><strong>Note:</strong> it is not yet available in the Software Center, but hopefully soon will!</em></p>

<h3>Building from Source</h3>

<p>For information on how to build Weather Desktop from source, see the README in the downloaded source code or in the <a href="https://github.com/iBeliever/weather-desktop">GitHub project</a>.</p>
