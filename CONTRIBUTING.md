### Code Checking ###

Automated code checking is very important, as it helps to catch subtle
errors in code. KDE (and thus Weather Desktop) uses a excellent code checker
called `krazy2`.

To run `krazy2` on Weather Desktop, first remove the build directory (this will
prevent `krazy2` from reporting errors in auto-generated code), and then run
this in the top-level directory of Weather Desktop:

    $ krazy2all > code_report
    
Then study the report it generates and fix any errors in your code.
